# CIFAR-10-using-PyTorch
I'm using the CIFAR10 dataset.
It has 10 classes: ‘plane’, ‘car’, ‘bird’, ‘cat’, ‘deer’,
‘dog’, ‘frog’, ‘horse’, ‘ship’, ‘truck’. The images in CIFAR-10 are of
size 3x32x32, i.e. 3-channel color images of 32x32 pixels in size.

My model classifies images into their respective classes using PyTorch.
As of now, it has an accuracy of 60.58%, having highest accuracy of 
80.6% of the 'plane' class and lowest accuracy of 37.8% of the 'bird' class.
