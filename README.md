# CIFAR-10-using-PyTorch
I'm using the CIFAR10 dataset.
It has the classes: ‘airplane’, ‘automobile’, ‘bird’, ‘cat’, ‘deer’,
‘dog’, ‘frog’, ‘horse’, ‘ship’, ‘truck’. The images in CIFAR-10 are of
size 3x32x32, i.e. 3-channel color images of 32x32 pixels in size.

Classifying images into the following classes using PyTorch.
